      <h1>Me, Professionally</h1>
      <h2 className='paragraph'>
        I've previously interned at NASA, the San Francisco Chronicle, and
        several other organizations. I've had experience in a variety of roles
        including digital design/development, data analytics, database
        marketing, political reporting and social media. Now, I want to use
        those skills to dive into the intersection of journalism, data science
        and design/development where storytelling thrives.
