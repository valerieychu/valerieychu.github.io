        <p className='paragraph'>
          Hi! I'm Valerie. If you've reached this Me section, you've likely seen
          a bit of my work! But if not, here's a quick summary:
        </p>
        <p className='paragraph'>
          I'm a storyteller passionate about working with data to design & code
          digital products that tell a story. I'm also a rising senior at
          Northwestern University triple majoring in data science, journalism
          and international studies.
          {/* I'm an aspiring data scientist who
          wants to use digital design/web development to tell the story behind
          the data.  */}
        </p>
        <p className='paragraph'>
          I'm a current NASA intern, a former San Francisco Chronicle intern,
          and I've also been at several other places. You can see my resume and
          a summary of my work experience below.
        </p>
        <p className='paragraph'>
          In my free time, I love reading, playing cello, taking photographs of
          my friends and family, and learning new languages.
