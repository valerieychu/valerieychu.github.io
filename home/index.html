Since each story featured photos taken during the entire round (ie. multiple games), we wanted to allow readers to visually track which game they&#x27;re looking at. As the designer/developer for the project, I created a custom scoreboard component.</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Tools used: </i>React, Figma, ArchieML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Process: </i>When creating the scoreboard component, I wanted to start by considering the history of old-school sports design. My mentor, Alex Fong, has a collection of newspaper designs from people including Vince Chiaramonte, Brian Gross and Wayne Kamidoi. After looking through some of their work as well as that of other designers, I began to pick up on particular ways of displaying fundamental sports information — with scoreboards being one such idea. Then my goal became to take the inspiration I gained from print sports design and make those ideas digitally presentable. I used Figma to design multiple scoreboard options, ultimately landing on one that could be reused for other sports including the WNBA, MLB and NFL.</p><p class="paragraph">The scoreboard’s dynamic design adjusts to mobile and desktop devices, and allows editors and writers to simply edit an ArchieML tag in Google Docs to change scoreboard components — team names, score and game number — without needing access to the code or coding skills. The scoreboard then auto-designs itself.</p><p class="paragraph">This scoreboard component was deployed for two Golden State Warriors photo stories. Since each photo story was published immediately after each NBA round, I utilized the scoreboard component and also designed/placed the game photos into each story under deadline. The scoreboard component exists as a San Francisco Chronicle component and will be reused for other sports we cover in the future.</p><button class="view-this-project" style="margin-right:1rem">View this project (1st story)</button><button class="view-this-project">View this project (2nd story)</button><video width="640" height="427" controls="" muted="" loop="" style="max-width:100%;border-radius:8px;margin-bottom:1rem"><source src="/scoreboard-component.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><h4 class="h4">San Francisco Chronicle — Investigative Series</h4><p class="paragraph">[Story not yet published] I worked from conception to execution on a long-term investigative project that will be published later in 2025.</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Tools used: </i>React, Figma, GSAP, Illustrator, ArchieML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Process: </i>When creating this project, I knew I had to look at it from both a product and storytelling perspective. It was a six part series consisting of over 5,000 words per part, so it was critical to keep readers engaged. With this in mind, and with the full creative control my mentor gave me over the project, I began designing and coding it. In particular, I focused on making two components.</p><p class="paragraph">The first was animating text messages. Text messages between the two main characters in the story were central to the storytelling process of this investigative piece, so I wanted to showcase the text messages somehow in each part of the series. I started by texting back and forth with my mentor, then studied how the text messages were sent and appeared. (One interesting thing I never noticed before was that when one person sends multiple texts, only the last text bubble gets an attribution arrow.) After looking through numerous photos on Google for additional text message bubble inspiration, I started designing a layout in InDesign then moved it to Figma when I decided I wanted to animate the text messages. After setting up the project within the Chronicle dev rig and getting the story working with ArchieML, I applied the typefaces, font colors and subtle gray-to-black background gradient to the project. Then I began animating the text messages using GSAP. It took a lot of YouTube videos, Googling, trial and error, and talking out my process with my mentor — but I overcame the learning curve and put together the animations! Along the way, I also learned how to use Illustrator to make SVGs work for the text bubble attributions and dived into dozens of niche Stack Overflow posts about animating using GSAP with React.</p><p class="paragraph">The second main element of the investigative project I focused on was a way to keep readers engaged with the article. When I first read a draft of the series in March, it was more than 30,000 words and took me 1 hour 45 minutes to finish reading from start to finish without breaks. While that was because I had the time to read it as part of working on its design/development, I knew most people wouldn’t finish reading the series in one continuous sitting. I needed to figure out how readers would engage with the series, then incorporate both storytelling features and product design to keep them hooked on the story. I started by developing user personas with our audience in mind, which comes from a wide range of backgrounds and with different daily reading habits. The most viable idea emerged as a bookmark modal — when the reader closes the tab or the app, their progress will be automatically saved. No matter which device they continue reading on, the page will resume from where they left off and a bookmark modal will appear, offering a brief summary of the story so far. I designed the bookmark modal and the user flow diagram for it using Figma. I pulled the data for the bookmark modal (ex. Summary hed and summary text applicable to each 25% of the story) from Google Sheets using ArchieML. I played around with different ways of using autosave — first, I tried calculating the scroll percentage and anchoring the bookmark modal to certain percentages. Then my mentor and I decided to make it more flexible, so we changed up our React hooks and used BlueConic to create the autosave feature.</p><p class="paragraph">I also prioritized both product design and accessibility when creating the bookmark modal. The Continue Reading button on the left side of the modal closes the bookmark modal and allows readers to pick up where they left off. The Start Over button on the right side of the modal deletes the bookmark/autosave progress and starts the reader back at the top of the story (which is useful if more than one person shares the same San Francisco Chronicle account). It’s also possible for the reader to close the modal through clicking on the Continue Reading button, the X button, Escape key or anywhere outside of the modal itself. All San Francisco Chronicle products are also coded with mobile-first design, all HTML tags are semantic, and all color contrast and font sizes are chosen to be easily understood whether the reader is using a screen reader or has color blindness.</p><p class="paragraph">By the end of my internship, I had used far more useStates, useEffects, useRefs and useContexts than I ever anticipated. Through working on this project from conception to execution, I gained a deep understanding of user design, product design and web design/development, allowing me to help bring this investigative series to life.</p><button class="view-this-project" style="margin-right:1rem">This investigative story will be published later in 2025</button><h4 class="h4">San Francisco Chronicle — Reusable video components</h4><p class="paragraph">San Francisco Chronicle photographers captured demonstrations throughout the Bay Area and Los Angeles of people protesting President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and the military parade held on his birthday. We already had a photo component that enabled us to to add and design photos in the template I set up for this project, but we didn&#x27;t have a compatible short video component. Under breaking news deadline, I took a horizontal video component from an existing code base I hadn’t worked with before and adapted it to this particular project template.</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Tools used: </i>React, ArchieML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Process: </i>Because this story was published under deadline, after setting up the story’s custom build, I immediately started working with people from the photo and video teams to lay out and design the photos in this story using the same custom ArchieML tags as other Chronicle photo stories (ex. as seen in the photos in the scoreboard project). But we had a few videos that captured key scenes at the protests — and we didn’t have an existing video component that worked for this template — so creating that became my main focus during the crunch period of assembling this story.</p><p class="paragraph">In a previous Chronicle project, we made a vertical video component that drew data from a video subsheet within a Google Sheet, but it wasn&#x27;t compatible with ArchieML/Google Docs. I imported several files from that project into this one; edited them to make them all work with ArchieML/Google Docs; changed the names of the files and components to be more intuitive (ex. interviewvideo.js became verticalvideohasaudio.js); renamed unintuitively named components and relinked them; changed the color of the scrub bar to our brand color; and changed the design of the video captions to be text width and in the right typeface.</p><p class="paragraph">Ultimately, I ended up creating a horizontal video component, a vertical component without audio, and a vertical component with audio — adapted under deadline from an existing codebase I hadn’t worked with before, and consistent with Chronicle video styles. Featuring photos/videos taken on Sunday, June 8 and updated daily over the course of a week, this photo/video story came in second for our web traffic on Saturday and took the lead on the following Sunday.</p><button class="view-this-project" style="margin-right:1rem">View this project</button><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPsJiwtwxb4?si=LygNLsmEO-YP3Szz" title="Photos and video show No Kings, ICE protests in Bay Area, Los Angeles" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="max-width:100%;margin-bottom:1rem"></iframe></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/home/";/*]]>*/</script><!-- slice-start id="_gatsby-scripts-1" -->
