Since each story featured photos taken during the entire round (ie. multiple games), we wanted to allow readers to visually track which game they&#x27;re looking at. As the designer/developer for the project, I created a custom scoreboard component.</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Tools used: </i>React, Figma, ArchieML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Process: </i>When creating the scoreboard component, I wanted to start by considering the history of old-school sports design. My mentor, Alex Fong, has a collection of newspaper designs from people including Vince Chiaramonte, Brian Gross and Wayne Kamidoi. After looking through some of their work as well as that of other designers, I began to pick up on particular ways of displaying fundamental sports information — with scoreboards being one such idea. Then my goal became to take the inspiration I gained from print sports design and make those ideas digitally presentable. I used Figma to design multiple scoreboard options, ultimately landing on one that could be reused for other sports including the WNBA, MLB and NFL.</p><p class="paragraph">The scoreboard’s dynamic design adjusts to mobile and desktop devices, and allows editors and writers to simply edit an ArchieML tag in Google Docs to change scoreboard components — team names, score and game number — without needing access to the code or coding skills. The scoreboard then auto-designs itself.</p><p class="paragraph">This scoreboard component was deployed for two Golden State Warriors photo stories. Since each photo story was published immediately after each NBA round, I utilized the scoreboard component and also designed/placed the game photos into each story under deadline. The scoreboard component exists as a San Francisco Chronicle component and will be reused for other sports we cover in the future.</p><button class="view-this-project" style="margin-right:1rem">View this project (1st story)</button><button class="view-this-project">View this project (2nd story)</button><video width="640" height="427" controls="" muted="" loop="" style="max-width:100%;border-radius:8px;margin-bottom:1rem"><source src="/scoreboard-component.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><h4 class="h4">San Francisco Chronicle — Investigative Story</h4><p class="paragraph">[Story not yet published] I worked from conception to execution on a long-term investigative project that will be published later in 2025.</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Tools used: </i>React, Figma, GSAP, Illustrator, ArchieML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Process: </i>Design inspo process</p><p class="paragraph">Design highlights</p><p class="paragraph">Design use</p><button class="view-this-project" style="margin-right:1rem">This investigative story will be published later in 2025</button><h4 class="h4">San Francisco Chronicle — Reusable video components</h4><p class="paragraph">San Francisco Chronicle photographers captured demonstrations throughout the Bay Area and Los Angeles of people protesting President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and the military parade held on his birthday. We already had a photo component that enabled us to to add and design photos in the template I set up for this project, but we didn&#x27;t have a compatible short video component. Under breaking news deadline, I took a horizontal video component from an existing code base I hadn’t worked with before and adapted it to this particular project template.</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Tools used: </i>React, ArchieML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p><p class="paragraph"><i>Process: </i>Because this story was published under deadline, after setting up the story’s custom build, I immediately started working with people from the photo and video teams to lay out and design the photos in this story using the same custom ArchieML tags as other Chronicle photo stories (ex. as seen in the photos in the scoreboard project). But we had a few videos that captured key scenes at the protests — and we didn’t have an existing video component that worked for this template — so creating that became my main focus during the crunch period of assembling this story.</p><p class="paragraph">In a previous Chronicle project, we made a vertical video component that drew data from a video subsheet within a Google Sheet, but it wasn&#x27;t compatible with ArchieML/Google Docs. I imported several files from that project into this one; edited them to make them all work with ArchieML/Google Docs; changed the names of the files and components to be more intuitive (ex. interviewvideo.js became verticalvideohasaudio.js); renamed unintuitively named components and relinked them; changed the color of the scrub bar to our brand color; and changed the design of the video captions to be text width and in the right typeface.</p><p class="paragraph">Ultimately, I ended up creating a horizontal video component, a vertical component without audio, and a vertical component with audio — adapted under deadline from an existing codebase I hadn’t worked with before, and consistent with Chronicle video styles. Featuring photos/videos taken on Sunday, June 8 and updated daily over the course of a week, this photo/video story came in second for our web traffic on Saturday and took the lead on the following Sunday.</p><button class="view-this-project" style="margin-right:1rem">View this project</button><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPsJiwtwxb4?si=LygNLsmEO-YP3Szz" title="Photos and video show No Kings, ICE protests in Bay Area, Los Angeles" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="max-width:100%;margin-bottom:1rem"></iframe></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/home/";/*]]>*/</script><!-- slice-start id="_gatsby-scripts-1" -->
